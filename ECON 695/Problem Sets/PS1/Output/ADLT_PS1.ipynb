    "\n",
    "- The sample mean $\\bar{Y}$ is an **unbiased estimator** of $p$. Across all cases, the average of $\\bar{Y}_r$ is relatively close to the true $p$.  \n",
    "- The estimated standard deviations $s_r$ are close to the theoretical $\\sqrt{p(1-p)}$, especially when $p=0.25$. For rare events ($p=0.05$), $s_r$ tends to be underestimated.  \n",
    "- The **coverage rate** of the Wald 95% CI:\n",
    "  - For $p=0.25$, coverage is close to 95%: about 0.94 at both $n=30$ and $n=60$.  \n",
    "  - For $p=0.05$, coverage drops badly to around 0.78–0.79, even at $n=60$.  \n",
    "    This shows the Wald CI is too narrow and under-covers when $p$ is small.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**So TL;DR:**\n",
    "The rule-of-thumb that \"$n \\geq 30$ is enough for asymptotic confidence intervals\" is **not reliable in all cases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For moderate $p$ (e.g. $0.25$), the Wald CI performs well even at $n=30$.  \n",
    "- For small $p$ (e.g. $0.05$), the Wald CI fails — coverage is far below 95%, even when $n=60$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The asymptotic confidence interval works well when $p$ is moderate, but not when $p$ is near 0 (rare events). In such cases, alternatives like Wilson, Agresti–Coull, or exact (Clopper–Pearson) intervals are recommended."

    "\n",
    "**Age trends:**  \n",
    "Cell phone use varies substantially with age. Younger individuals show higher usage across nearly all categories (texting, browsing, social media, etc.), while usage declines steadily with age. Phone calls remain consistently high across ages.\n",

    "**Gender differences:**  \n",
